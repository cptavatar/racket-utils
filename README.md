# racket-utils
This is an experiment in rewriting some semi-complex shell scripts I use for work I keep having to update in racket.

#Why racket? 
I wanted a lisp, I like clojure but didn't want a JVM. I used plt-scheme way back, felt a little nostalgic. I probably could have just continued with ever-growing shell or written something quicker in something else but this seemed like more fun.
